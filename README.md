# hello-world

Hi Everyone! I was once a cobol, basic and pascal programmer back in the early 80's. In the 90's played with web deisgn and did some cgi programming. Then got out of it. Well, I would like to get back in it as retirement is coming up a couple of years and I have an idea for an app (if I can keep up lol).
